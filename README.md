# Deep Learning Matlab Framework

## Introduction
Implementation of Deeplearning library based on my books:
* https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/content/
* https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/opencl/content/

### Objectives
The idea is to create a library as readable as possible while maintaning usability by giving the following features
* C/C++ code generation support
* Support for low-end platforms like raspbery PI
* Allows graphical representation of models on simulink
* GPU implementation on both CUDA and OpenCL
* Usage of matlab distributed features for scaling and performance

### Tutorials or references
All documentation will be available through my books or youtube channel. I will add tutorials as needed.
